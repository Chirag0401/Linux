- Mount and unmount filesystems carefully to avoid data loss.
- Use `fsck` to ensure filesystem health.
- Leverage LVM for flexible and dynamic storage management.

# **3. Boot Process**

The Linux boot process is a sequence of steps that initializes the hardware and software required to run the operating system. This section provides a detailed explanation of the key components involved in the boot process.

---

## **3.1 GRUB Bootloader**

### **What**
- GRUB (Grand Unified Bootloader) is the first software that runs after the system BIOS/UEFI initializes the hardware.
- It loads and transfers control to the Linux kernel.

### **Why**
- GRUB allows multi-booting, letting users choose between multiple operating systems.
- It enables advanced boot parameters (e.g., recovery mode or single-user mode).

### **When**
- GRUB is invoked during system startup to load the kernel.
- It is used when you need to debug kernel issues or boot into a specific configuration.

### **How**
- View the current GRUB configuration:
  ```bash
  cat /boot/grub2/grub.cfg
  ```
- Update GRUB after changes:
  ```bash
  grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg
  ```
- Access GRUB menu during boot by pressing `Shift` or `Esc` (depending on your distribution).
- Add kernel boot parameters temporarily:
  1. Highlight the kernel entry.
  2. Press `e` to edit.
  3. Append parameters (e.g., `single`) to the `linux` line.

---

## **3.2 BIOS/UEFI Boot Process**

### **What**
- **BIOS (Basic Input/Output System)**: Legacy firmware interface initializing hardware and locating the bootloader.
- **UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface)**: Modern replacement for BIOS with enhanced features like faster booting and secure boot.

### **Why**
- UEFI provides better performance, security (via Secure Boot), and supports large storage devices.
- BIOS is still supported on older hardware.

### **When**
- BIOS/UEFI runs before the OS to perform hardware initialization and start the bootloader.

### **How**
- Check if your system uses BIOS or UEFI:
  ```bash
  ls /sys/firmware/efi
  ```
  - If the directory exists, the system uses UEFI.
- Access BIOS/UEFI settings during boot by pressing keys like `F2`, `F10`, or `Del`.

---

## **3.3 Kernel Initialization**

### **What**
- After GRUB loads the kernel into memory, the kernel initializes:
  - Hardware drivers.
  - Memory management.
  - Filesystems.
- The kernel then starts the **`init`** or **`systemd`** process.

### **Why**
- The kernel is responsible for interacting with hardware and preparing the system for user processes.

### **When**
- Kernel initialization occurs immediately after the bootloader hands over control.

### **How**
- Check the kernel version:
  ```bash
  uname -r
  ```
- View kernel boot parameters:
  ```bash
  cat /proc/cmdline
  ```

---

## **3.4 `init`, `systemd`, and Runlevels/Targets**

### **`init`**

- **Why**: Provides a sequential process for starting services and daemons.
- **When**: Used in older distributions (e.g., RHEL 5 or earlier).

### **Runlevels**
- Define the state of the system (e.g., multi-user, graphical, single-user mode):
  - `0`: Halt
  - `1`: Single-user mode
  - `3`: Multi-user mode (text-based)
  - `5`: Multi-user mode (graphical)
  - `6`: Reboot

- **Check current runlevel**:
  ```bash
  runlevel
  ```

### **`systemd`**
- **What**: A modern initialization system that replaces `init`.
- **Why**:
  - Offers parallel service startup.
  - Uses **targets** instead of runlevels for flexibility.
  - Provides tools like `systemctl` for service management.

### **Targets**
- Examples:
  - `multi-user.target`: Equivalent to runlevel 3.
  - `graphical.target`: Equivalent to runlevel 5.
  - `rescue.target`: Equivalent to runlevel 1 (single-user mode).

- **Check current target**:
  ```bash
  systemctl get-default
  ```
- **Change default target**:
  ```bash
  systemctl set-default multi-user.target
  ```
- **Boot into a specific target**:
  ```bash
  systemctl isolate rescue.target
  ```

---

## **3.5 Boot Logs**

### **What**
- Boot logs provide detailed information about the system startup process, including errors and warnings.

### **Why**
- Essential for diagnosing boot-related issues or delays.

### **When**
- Use boot logs when troubleshooting failed services or slow startup.

### **How**
1. View recent boot logs:
   ```bash
   journalctl -b
   ```
2. Filter logs for a specific service:
   ```bash
   journalctl -u sshd
   ```
3. View older boot logs:
   ```bash
   journalctl --list-boots
   journalctl -b -1
   ```
4. Check logs from traditional logging systems:
   ```bash
   cat /var/log/boot.log
   ```

---

## **Summary of the Boot Process**
1. **BIOS/UEFI** initializes hardware and passes control to the bootloader.
2. **GRUB** loads the kernel and optional parameters.
3. **Kernel** initializes hardware drivers and mounts the root filesystem.
4. **`init`/`systemd`** starts system services and the user environment.
5. System logs provide details for troubleshooting and monitoring the process.

---

### Example Commands for Troubleshooting
- Force a filesystem check during boot:
  ```bash
  touch /forcefsck
  ```
- Rebuild GRUB configuration:
  ```bash
  grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg
  ```
- Debug failed services:
  ```bash
  systemctl status <service-name>
  journalctl -xe
  ```

## **Summary**
- **CPU Monitoring**: Use `mpstat`, `sar`, `top`, and `htop` to diagnose high CPU usage.
- **Memory Monitoring**: Use `free` and `vmstat` to identify memory pressure or excessive swap usage.
- **Disk Monitoring**: Use `iostat`, `df`, `du`, and `iotop` to troubleshoot disk space and I/O issues.
- **Network Monitoring**: Use `netstat`, `ss`, `iftop`, and `tcpdump` to analyze connectivity and bandwidth.
- **Log Analysis**: Use `journalctl`, `dmesg`, and `/var/log` files to investigate system activity and errors.

These tools are critical for maintaining system health and resolving performance issues effectively.
